## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python (variables, functions, classes)
- Enthusiasm to learn! 🎉

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minesweeper-ai.git
   cd minesweeper-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (currently none required for basic functionality)
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the basic game**
   ```bash
   python examples/basic_game.py
   ```

4. **Try the AI**
   ```bash
   python examples/ai_demo.py
   ```

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Beginner (Week 1-2)
1. **Understand the Game**: Play the basic Minesweeper to understand rules
2. **Read the Code**: Study `minesweeper_game.py` to understand game mechanics
3. **Complete Tutorial 1**: Basic game modifications in `docs/TUTORIALS.md`

### Intermediate (Week 3-4)
1. **Study AI Basics**: Read `docs/AI_CONCEPTS.md`
2. **Implement Safe Moves**: Complete the `is_safe_move` function
3. **Complete Tutorial 2**: Add simple AI logic

### Advanced (Week 5-6)
1. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Implement CSP-based reasoning
2. **Probability Estimation**: Add probabilistic move selection
3. **Complete Tutorial 3**: Build a complete AI solver

## 💻 Code Examples

### Basic Game Usage
```python
from src.minesweeper_game import Minesweeper

# Create a 9x9 board with 10 mines
game = Minesweeper(9, 9, 10)

# Make moves
result = game.uncover(4, 4)  # Uncover center cell
game.flag(0, 0)              # Flag a suspected mine

# Print current state
game.print_board()
```

### AI Usage
```python
from src.minesweeper_game import Minesweeper
from src.minesweeper_ai import MinesweeperAI

# Create game and AI
game = Minesweeper(9, 9, 10)
ai = MinesweeperAI(game)

# Let AI make a move
ai.make_move()
game.print_board()
```

## 🧠 Key AI Concepts

1. **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**
   - Using numbered cells to constrain mine locations
   - Logical deduction from partial information

2. **Probability Estimation**
   - When logic isn't enough, estimate mine probabilities
   - Choose moves with lowest risk

3. **Frontier Analysis**
   - Focus on border between known and unknown areas
   - Most information gained from frontier cells
